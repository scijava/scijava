# SciJava Concurrent: A Lightweight Framework for Task Execution

This module provides a framework for executing `Runnable`s and `Callable`s. By abstracting the evaluation of functionality, we can enable the framework to intelligently execute code, increasing performance.

## The `Parallelziation` class

This class provides many static utilities for executing functionality.

## The `TaskExecutor` interface

This interface provides the API for users to execute functionality, while hiding the actual implementation of that execution.
