/**
 * Log describing each execution of an Op. This class is designed to answer two
 * questions:
 * <ol>
 * <li>What Op(s) produced and/or mutated this output?</li>
 * <li>Given an {@link Object} op, what {@link OpInfo}s (including dependencies)
 * were utilized to implement that Op's functionality?</li>
 * </ol>
 * The answers to these two questions allow users to produce an entire
 * {@code List<Graph<OpInfo>>}, containing all of the information needed to
 * reproduce any {@link Object} output.
 * <p>
 * Note that SciJava Ops is responsible for logging the returns to <b>any</b>
 * matching calls here, but with some effort the user or other applications
 * could also contribute their algorithms to the history.
