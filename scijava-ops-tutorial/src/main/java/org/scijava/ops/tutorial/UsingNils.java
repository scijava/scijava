 * SciJvaa Ops allows users to take advantage of the strong type safety of the
 * Java language, which can provide benefits in certainty and efficiency. The
 * downside of this is verbosity, especially in obtaining generically-typed
 * outputs from OpBuilder calls.
 * <p>
 * Luckily, SciJava Ops allows you to specify the generic types of outputs using
 * the {@link Nil} type, as shown in this tutorial.
