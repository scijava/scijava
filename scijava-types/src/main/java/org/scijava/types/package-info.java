/**
 * This package org.scijava.types; runtime, beyond what is offered by SciJava
 * Common's {@link org.scijava.types.Types} class. This package offers the
 * following additional features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Reason about whether a collection of arguments (object instances, generic
 * types, or a mixture thereof) satisfy a given list of generic types, such as
 * those of a particular method signature. See
 * {@link org.scijava.types.TypeTools#satisfies} for details.</li>
 * <li>Create {@link org.scijava.types.Nil} objects, which act as "typed null"
 * placeholders, and support generation of proxy instances of their associated
 * generic type, similar to (but less featureful than) how mocking frameworks
 * create mock objects.</li>
 * <li>Recover erased generic type information from object instances at runtime,
 * in an extensible way, via {@link org.scijava.types.TypeExtractor} plugins and
 * the {@link TypeService#reify} method. E.g., you can learn that an object of
 * class {@link java.util.HashMap} is actually (or at least functionally) a
 * {@code HashMap<String, Integer>}.</li>
 * </ul>
