/**
 * Creates an isotropic BiGauss kernel
 * with the pair of sigmas specification.
 * <p>
 * The BiGauss kernel is a composition of two standard Gauss kernels. If
 * we were to assume 1D kernel centered at zero (0), an inner kernel of the
 * BiGauss, with its shape given with sigmas[0], would span from -sigmas[0]
 * till +sigmas[0]; outer kernel, with its shape given with sigmas[1],
 * surrounds the inner, e.g. for the positive side, from sigmas[0] till
 * sigmas[0]+2*sigmas[1] and its center having at sigmas[0]-sigmas[1].
 * That is, the inner Gauss exist up to its inflection points from which
 * the filter takes shape of the outer Gauss. Both kernels are, however, 
 * appropriately scaled and shifted to obtain a smooth BiGauss kernel.
 * <p>
 * Note that the kernel is always isotropic.
 * The second parameter gives dimensionality of the created kernel.
 * <p>
 * All values are in units of pixels.
