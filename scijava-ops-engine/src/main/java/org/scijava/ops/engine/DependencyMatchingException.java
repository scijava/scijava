/**
 * An {@link OpMatchingException} caused by another {@code OpMatchingException}
 * thrown when resolving dependencies. We illustrate the need for
 * {@code DependencyMatchingException} with an example: Suppose Op {@code A} has
 * an dependency on Op {@code B}, which in turn has a dependency on Op
 * {@code C}. Suppose further that {@code A} and {@code B} are found, but no
 * {@code C} is found to satisfy {@code B}. This will result in an
 * {@link OpMatchingException} thrown for Op {@code A}. We would want to know:
 * <ol>
 * <li>that the request for {@code A} was not fulfilled</li>
 * <li>that no match could be found for {@code C}, which was the cause for
 * (1)</li>
 * </ol>
 * This logic can be generalized for an arbitrarily long Op chain. TODO:
 * Consider supporting non-DependencyMatchingException {@code cause}s.
