	 * IEEE Trans. System, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-8 (1978) 630-632.]<br>
	 * The procedure divides the image into objects and background by taking<br>
	 * an<br>
	 * initial threshold, then the averages of the pixels at or below the<br>
	 * threshold and pixels above are computed. The averages of those two<br>

	 * are computed, the threshold is incremented and the process is<br>
	 * repeated<br>
	 * until the threshold is larger than the composite average. That is,<br>
	 * threshold = (average background + average objects)/2<br>
	 * The code in ImageJ that implements this function is the<br>
	 * getAutoThreshold() method in the ImageProcessor class.<br>

	 * The algorithm implemented in NIH Image sets the threshold as that<br>

	 * value, G, for which the average of the averages of the grey values<br>
	 * below and above G is equal to G. It does this by initialising G to<br>

	 * <br>
	 * L = the average grey value of pixels with intensities < G<br>
	 * H = the average grey value of pixels with intensities > G<br>
	 * is G = (L + H)/2?<br>
	 * yes => exit<br>
	 * no => increment G and repeat<br>

	 * There is a discrepancy with IJ because of slightly different methods
