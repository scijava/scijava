# SciJava Taglets: Documentation Support for `FunctionalInterface` `Fields`

This project is designed to provide a `Field` analog to the `@param`/`@return` javadoc tags. Just as one might wish to describe the parameters of a method, it is similarly useful to be able to describe the inputs and outputs of a `FunctionalInterface` `Field`. The set of taglets in this project aim to provide that functionality.

Note that this project is spiritually aligned with the `FunctionalInterface`s provided within SciJava Functions.
