		SciJava Ops Image is a library for scientific image processing. The
		fundamental currency of this library are individual algorithms called Ops.

		All Ops share a few traits that establish a baseline of expected behavior:

		1. Ops are stateless - with no internal state, calling an Op two times on
		the same inputs will produce the same output.

		2. Ops are limited to one output - by limiting Ops to one output, we ensure
		that the algorithms we write are reusable building blocks. Of course,
		algorithms always need inputs, and there are no limitations on the number
		of inputs.

		3. Ops have a strong functional type - Java has a strong type system, and
		Ops utilizes this to maximize expressiveness and efficiency.

		4. Ops have at least one name - this name conveys an Op's purpose
