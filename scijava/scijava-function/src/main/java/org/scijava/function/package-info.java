/**
 * Provides a set of lightweight <b>functional interfaces</b>.

 * The package is named in accordance with {@code java.util.function}, as the
 * Function and Consumer interfaces housed within this package are designed as
 * extensions of {@link java.util.function.Function} /
 * {@link java.util.function.BiFunction} and {@link java.util.function.Consumer}
 * / {@link java.util.function.BiConsumer} respectively. The name should
 * <b>not</b> be confused with the usage of "function" within SciJava Ops or any
 * other project.
