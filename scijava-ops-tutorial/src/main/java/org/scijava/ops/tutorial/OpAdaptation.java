/**
 * One powerful feature of SciJava Ops is the ability to transform individual
 * Ops to match user requests. In this way, SciJava Ops can satisfy many
 * different Op calls with just one implementation.
 * <p>
 * The simplest type of transformation is termed "adaptation". Adaptation
 * involves transforming an Op into a different functional type. A set of
 * "engine.adapt" Ops exist to perform this transformation, taking in any Op of
 * functional type X and returning an Op of functional type Y.
 * <p>
 * Adaptation can be used to call a Function like a Computer, or to call an Op
 * that operates on Doubles like an Op that operates on a List of Doubles.
 * <p>
 * Below, we can see how this works by calling the above Field Op, supposed to
 * work on Doubles, on an array of Doubles[]
