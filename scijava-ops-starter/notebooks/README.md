# SciJava Ops FLIM notebooks

This directory contains interactive tutorials for SciJava Ops FLIM, presented as Jupyter Notebooks.

## Running the notebooks locally

To run these notebooks, create a [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) environment using the `environment.yml` located in this project's base directory. Once you have the `scijava-ops-flim` environment created and activated, you can run `jupyter notebook` on the command line to view the notebooks!
